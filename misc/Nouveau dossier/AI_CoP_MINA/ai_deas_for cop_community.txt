- How we can export specific content from one file to template bound new file format
	- Description: The idea is to show case how we can leverage Copilot agentic ai from Teams to transform file formats in a natural language way
	- Prompt: 
		Transform the content from ai_deas_for cop_community.txt to knowledge_sharing_template.txt. 
		Make the new document concise and only include the requested fields in the template. 
		Don't create a new file just yet, I need to approve the transformed content first through an approval action if possible.
		The newly created file name should be in the the following format cop_ideas_<date and time>.txt. 
		The <date and time> in the filename is a placeholder and should reflect the actual file creation date and time.
		Are you able to check the current date and time using UTC timezone and modify it in the filename placeholder ? Be accurate no hallucination.
