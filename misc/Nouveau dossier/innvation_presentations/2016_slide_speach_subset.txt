- The SGW team in Tunis has been created about two years ago, in July 2014 and it is composed of three teams L2 TS, QA and Dev that are acting as a single entity when it comes to issue resolution and feature development.

- The implementation team has moved to Agile-Scrum practices recently and we are currently trying to share the Agile transformation experience with Pune to benefit the wider team, and improve our processes globally. 

- The team is working in tendem with the global SGW team where: 
	- Agile has contributed to bridge the gap between teams cross locations, where the BA is now part of the Scrum team acting as a Product Owner for those projects that are developed in Tunis.
	- Also an ongoing project collaboration initiative between Dev team in Tunis and the QA team in Pune is on the way to enhance our bespoke Test Automation tool and try to improve our customer satisfaction
	- Tunis QA team is also getting involved for test and validation of a number of  projects that are developed in Pune
	- Last and not least L2 TS team in Tunis is liasing and proactively collaborating on a daily basis with the CS, L2 and L3 teams across locations to fast track case resolution and improve our TS metrics
	
- All in all, in less than two years, the team has managed to provide a number of quality Software and TS services, and contributed in global success of SGW team worldwide. And we look forward to continue improving our processes and products.
