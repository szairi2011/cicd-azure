*** Groovy useful artifacts for the WF identification ***

- Closue delegation and DSL API

- List.finAll(closure)

- Safe navigation using ? character to avoid NPE exception: e.g. it.messages[i]?.TradCaptRpt?.TransTyp? == 0

- Use of GPath to traverse object and data structure elements alike

- Use of GString which offer richer feature than Java String, e.g. simple templates including ${} like placeholders

- Template engines e.g. Use MarkupTemplateEngine to create FIXML samples where placeholders can be used

- XMLSlurper for xml parsing...

- JSONSlurper for JSON parsing...

- AST for compilation time processing, e.g. to add handy constructor or getters and setters by the Groovy compiler while keeping the code concise

- Meta Object Model including use of methodMissing() and setProperty(String property, Object o), and getProperty(property) for runtime processing of missing methods and properties
