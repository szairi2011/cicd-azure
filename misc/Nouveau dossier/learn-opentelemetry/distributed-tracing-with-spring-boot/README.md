In this repository I explored some distributed tracing implementation.

1. 
![Zipkin](readme-images/zipkin.png)

[ [Spring Cloud Sleuth with Zipkin](distributed-tracing-spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin) ] - In this project I have explored how I can integrate spring cloud sleuth and visualize the tracing using Zipkin.

2. 
![Jaeger Image](readme-images/jaeger.png)

[ [Spring Boot With Jaeger Tracing based on OpenTracing ](distributed-tracing-spring-cloud-jaeger) ] - In this project I have explored how to integrate Spring Cloud Jaeger with a Spring Boot application and then visualize the traces in a Jaeger server


3.
![OpenTelemetry Image](readme-images/open-telemetry.png)

[ [Spring Boot With OpenTelemetry Jaeger Tracing ](distributed-tracing-spring-boot-opentelemetry-jaeger) ] - In this project I have explored how to integrate OpenTelemetry in a Spring Boot application and then visualize the traces in a Jaeger server
